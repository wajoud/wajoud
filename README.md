-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a developer working on creating end to end Data science Pipeline, with G-streamer as a bridge to connect the surveillance system with the machine learning Modules such as detection(person, car, Elephent), activity detection, and tracking of bounding boxes. 


-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Different concepts of Machine learning algorithms, using reinforcement learning as a strategy for my learning process, by rewarding myself on every achievement toward ML

-âš¡ Fun fact :- Food and MusicðŸŽµ are the reasons to live.
